    <p2>Liverpool FC lose Sadio Mane and Mo Salah, two of their 
    best players, for the next month due to their international
    duties at the African Cup of Nations tournament. It will be
    interesting to see how Liverpool will lineup without their
    two star wingers that have brought them so much success 
    over the last few seasons. They will have to ajust their
    tactics drasticlly over the next few games because of how
    much they rely on the speed of Mane and Salah. It will
    certainly be an interesting couple of weeks for Liverpool
    in the Premier League as they attempt to keep their title
    hopes alive.</p2>

    <p3>It will be interesting to see who will win the English
    Premier League this season. Right now Manchester Ctiy are
    the obvious favourites to win the whole thing because of
    their big 11 point lead at the top of the table. However
    in second place at with one game in hand Liverpool are
    hoping to close that gap and try to steal the title away
    from Manchester City. At the start of the season a lot
    of people had Chelsea as their favourites to win the Premier
    League, however after winning just four of their last
    twelve games, they seem too far behind Liverpool and Manchester
    City. </p3>
